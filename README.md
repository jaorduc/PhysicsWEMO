## 0. Python Basics <a name = pythoBas01></a>

There are a lot of websites to study python; however, I would like to share some extra basic material created by some groups where I worked, the most of the material was created by students, I hope you enjoy it and it helps in your practice.

## Python repositories and other resources

1. (https://www.learnpython.org/)[Python 01]
1. (https://github.com/UNAM-FESAc)[Python 02]



## 1. Electricity <a name = electric01></a>
Exercises and examples about physics 230

## Exercises and examples: Electric Field, Electric potential, Charge and more

File [EM_1.ipynb](https://github.com/jaorduc/PhysicsWEMO/blob/main/EM_1.ipynb) is the implementation for some 
equations such as
```math
\vec{E} = k \frac{Q}{r^2} \hat{r}
```
where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector, $k=8.99\times 10^9 N m^2 C^{-2}$ is a constant, $Q$ is the charge, $r$ is the distance, 
and $\hat{r}$ is an unit vector which indicates the vector direction.

Besides, you have some exercises with Coulomb's law,
```math
\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
```
where there are two charges, $q_1$ and $q_2.$

On the other hand, you will have some exercises which relates force and electric field,
```math
\vec{F} = Q~\vec{E}
```
where $Q$ is a test charge.




Here you find some extra material, I will try to put all the references; however, let me know if I missed any paper, repository or slides.
I will happy to put your material like part of my documentation.
