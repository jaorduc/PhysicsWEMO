File [EM_1.ipynb](https://github.com/jaorduc/PhysicsWEMO/blob/main/EM_1.ipynb) is the implementation for some 
equations such as
```math
\vec{E} = k \frac{Q}{r^2} \hat{r}
```
where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector, $k=8.99\times 10^9 N m^2 C^{-2}$ is a constant, $Q$ is the charge, $r$ is the distance, 
and $\hat{r}$ is an unit vector which indicates the vector direction.

Besides, you have some exercises with Coulomb's law,
```math
\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
```
where there are two charges, $q_1$ and $q_2.$

On the other hand, you will have some exercises which relates force and electric field,
```math
\vec{F} = Q~\vec{E}
```
where $Q$ is a test charge.
